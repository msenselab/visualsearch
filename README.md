# Modeling target search behavior
Original data from Zhuanghua Shi group at LMU

Current implementation includes an ad-hoc model with a simplified ideal observer accumulating evidence from a dynamic
(rapidly changing) set of visual stimuli which may or may not include the target, and a static case model in which the 
field of stimuli is fixed in presentation. Code largely in Python with some implemented in MATLAB.
